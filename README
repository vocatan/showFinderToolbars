I wanted to learn more about how to use github, and was trying to
think of what I had recently done would be useful to others.

Not sure if this quite meets that critera, but for what it is 
worth, here it is.

On a Mac, if you open a Finder window, you can drag applications,
folders, etc, onto the toolbar.

When you do this, you can still move your mouse to hover over the
item, and Finder will tell you what that item represents.  

What if you want to get a dump of ALL the items that you have on
your toolbar?
